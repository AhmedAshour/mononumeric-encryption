# Mono-numeric Substitution Encryption
This simple encryption program is made for the 8086 microprocessor. 
In the mono-numeric substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by a
number according to the following table:

| Plain Text | Cipher Text | 
|--|--|
| a | 1 |
| b | 2 |
| c | 3 |
| d | 4 |
| e | 5 |
| f | 6 |
| g | 7 |
| h | 8 |
| i | 9 |
| j | 10 |
| k | 11 |
| l | 12 |
| m | 13 |
| n | 14 |
| o | 15 |
| p | 16 |
| q | 17 |
| r | 18 |
| s | 19 |
| t | 20 |
| u | 21 |
| v | 22 |
| w | 23 |
| x | 24 |
| y | 25 |
| z | 26 |

## Solution
1. Constructing the table and storing it in the memory.
2. Writing a program to encrypt the input message
3. Decrypting the cipher text to obtain the original text message.
